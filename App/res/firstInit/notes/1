Hi, it's *"Simple Note"*. Its applications can create and store your notes. It
has some features:

* It can save your notes after you exit the app. But don't forgive saves you
  note (for this you need to push `Save` button).
* It supports Markdown syntax. Check note ***Markdown example***.
* You can change font and font size.
* It builds on Qt, so it will be looked like your system.

A few **important** moments:

1.  All note opens *only for read*. For change text you need push button `Edit`.
2.  Don't forgive about saves your note.
3.  Don't use hiding content, you lose content.
